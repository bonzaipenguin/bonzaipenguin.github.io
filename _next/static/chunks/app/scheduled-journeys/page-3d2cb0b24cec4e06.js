Scheduled Journeys operate continuously, with the audience constantly updating. When a user meets the specified criteria, they are funneled into the beginning of the journey.

I began collaborating with the Cheetah Digital team to design filters and campaign creation UIs to simplify the setup process for the assets in a Scheduled Journey. The team initially struggled to understand the technical requirements of a Scheduled Journey and how these would impact the workflow within Cheetah Digital. Due to these technical concerns, the engineering team took over the design process, shifting my role to a production designer. This involved minor adjustments like removing list items from drop-down menus, changing button designs, and adding labels to title bars. Consequently, the time required to scope and re-scope the project and the need to address technical requirements negatively affected the launch timeline, which shifted from January 2025 to the end of Q2, possibly extending into Q3."}),(0,t.jsx)("p",{children:"In my retrospective on the project, I identified several key design issues that could have ensured the delivery of a user-friendly feature, despite it being a cross-application product. One of the most important lessons learned is not to be afraid of pushing back against senior engineers and directors when user considerations are being overlooked. Additionally, it’s essential to visualize the ideal UI design and use it as a discussion foundation. I also emphasize the need for clarity and efficiency in planning; we don’t have three months to finalize how a product feature will be scoped.
